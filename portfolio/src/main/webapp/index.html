      <p>I'm a rising freshman at Williams College, with a prospective double major in computer science and music. In my free time I love making music, working out, 
          and playing computer games in my free time!</p>

      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I was born in Arizona, and I grew up in a family of six, with three older brothers. Growing up the son of two immigrants, I learned how to budget my little time 
         and resources to work hard at what I prioritized, something I learned from watching my parents who budgeted their time and resources in order to provide me and 
         my brothers an education and constantly care for those around them. These are things that I practice each day, striving to work hard in every task I'm given and 
         to help as many people as I can, and above all, remaining grateful for all the opportunities and privileges I've been granted.</p>
