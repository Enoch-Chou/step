      <h1>Enoch Chou's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      
      <p>I'm a rising freshman at Williams College, with a prospective double
         major in computer science and music. In my free time I love making 
         music, working out, and playing computer games!</p>

      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I was born in Arizona, and I grew up in a family of six, with three 
         older brothers. Growing up the son of two immigrants, I learned how
         to budget my little time and resources to work hard at what I 
         prioritized, something I learned from watching my parents who
         budgeted their time and resources in order to provide me and my 
         brothers an education and constantly care for those around them. 
         These are things that I practice each day, striving to work hard
         in every task I'm given and to help as many people as I can, and 
         above all, remaining grateful for all the opportunities and 
         privileges I've been granted.</p>

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>Here is a list of some of my past computer science projects:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Final Exam Scheduler</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a final exam scheduler using vector of vectors 
                    of strings (representing the exam schedule) and a graph 
                    (representing all the courses) in Java.</li>
                <li>The program reads in a list of Students and their classes,
                     and uses a greedy algorithm to create a school-wide class 
                     schedule with the condition that any given student should
                     not be double booked in the same exam block</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Text Imitator</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a vector (arraylist) of associations (similar to 
                    hashmaps) in Java to create a program that imitates the 
                    writing style of an inputted text.</li>
                <li>Processed the input text by going through the text and counting
                    and storing the frequency of each letter appearing after a 
                    certain letter or set of letters in a vector of associations.
                    It then uses the data from the vector of associations to 
                    randomly generate letters according to what follows beforehand. </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Ghostscript</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Leveraged stacks in Java to create a partial implementation of Ghostscript,
                    an interpreter for Postscript, a stack-based programming language used for
                    generating vector graphics</li>
                <li>Verified that Postscript could be successfully interpreted through test-driven
                    development</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
