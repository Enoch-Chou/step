      <p>I'm a rising freshman at Williams College, with a prospective double
         major in computer science and music. In my free time I love making 
         music, working out, and playing computer games!</p>

      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>Here is a list of some of my past computer science projects:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Final Exam Scheduler</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a final exam scheduler using vector of vectors 
                    of strings (representing the exam schedule) and a graph 
                    (representing all the courses) in Java.</li>
                <li>The program reads in a list of Students and their classes,
                     and uses a greedy algorithm to create a school-wide class 
                     schedule with the condition that any given student should
                     not be double booked in the same exam block</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Text Imitator</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a vector (arraylist) of associations (similar to 
                    hashmaps) in Java to create a program that imitates the 
                    writing style of an inputted text.</li>
                <li>Processed the input text by going through the text and counting
                    and storing the frequency of each letter appearing after a 
                    certain letter or set of letters in a vector of associations.
                    It then uses the data from the vector of associations to 
                    randomly generate letters according to what follows beforehand. </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Ghostscript</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Leveraged stacks in Java to create a partial implementation of Ghostscript,
                    an interpreter for Postscript, a stack-based programming language used for
                    generating vector graphics</li>
                <li>Verified that Postscript could be successfully interpreted through test-driven
                    development</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
